Beautiful Nairobi, December 2024. We were high off life after being named [winners in Block’s TBD Hackathon](https://themandatelive.com/block-announces-winner-in-tbd-hackathon-at-africa-bitcoin-conference-highlighting-innovation-in-payments-across-africa/). We had built a no-internet-required solution for travellers to make local payments without needing local payment methods.

Imagine landing in Kenya with no local SIM card, no understanding of M-Pesa, and no idea of the exchange rates, yet still being able to pay for things from your phone. That was tbDEX Go.

We were thrilled to have our idea validated and excited for the opportunity to scale our solution. Shortly after, however, the division at Block pioneering the technology was discontinued. This meant the partnerships with financial institutions that our solution relied on were no longer available.

Leaving us with the ~~million~~ ten-thousand-dollar question:

> what were we going to build?

In reality, it wasn't much of a question. We already knew what we wanted to build and why we wanted to build it. We just weren't sure how.

## I’m not poor, I just need more money

In 2021, I joined the workforce. Fresh-faced, expectant about all the things I could get by myself with my newfound income. Reality however, is often disappointing.

My first paycheck came in, and I thought, "Wow, this is all mine?" Nope. I was broke before the end of the month.
In fact, I was living paycheck to paycheck, broke before the end of every month. I wasn't too worried, though. It was an entry-level job, so being broke felt like part of the deal. Things would get better. Right?

I gained skills, earned more, and changed jobs. I even juggled two roles for a while. The result was always the same: broke before the end of the month.

It slowly dawned on me that just earning more wasn't the answer to my financial problems.

## Where's your money going then?

I went online searching for answers and discovered I wasn't alone. There's a whole community of people trying to get control of their finances and break the stress-inducing silence around money. I found amazing YouTubers like [Nischa](https://www.youtube.com/@nischa) and [Humphrey Yang](https://www.youtube.com/@humphrey), who all preached the first rule of personal finance:

> To make any sense of your money, you need to know where it's going.

This sounded simple enough: I needed to track my spending. I started with a spreadsheet template from Nischa, logging every expense and comparing it against my budget.

The shift was monumental. Knowing where my money was going allowed me to be more intentional with my spending. I could cover my essentials and still have money left for guilt-free spending on things I wanted.

## Better days

This was great, but there was a catch: manual data entry. My motivation kept me going for a while, but I soon started looking for a more sustainable solution.

I found apps like YNAB and Spendee that promised a better interface and automatic bank syncing. No more manual entry! Or so I thought. They didn't work for me. None of them did, actually. The bank sync feature never worked because my local banks weren't even listed.

In 2023, Eloke and I started talking about this problem. We decided to build a personal finance app that lets people track their spending automatically. We quickly discovered why this feature was missing from other apps:

> Open Banking is a myth.

Especially in Africa.

## Solutions!

We're taking a radically different approach. Our app is able to automatically track your spending without you having to give us your bank logins. It is AI-native so managing your finances is as easy as talking to a friend - talk to your money. And it all lives on your phone.

We've been using it internally already and it's been great. Excited for you to try it out soon too, sign up for the waitlist here - [budgeai.com](https://www.budgeai.com)
