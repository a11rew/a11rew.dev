Beautiful Nairobi city, December 2024. High off life after being adjudged [winners in Block’s TBD Hackathon](https://themandatelive.com/block-announces-winner-in-tbd-hackathon-at-africa-bitcoin-conference-highlighting-innovation-in-payments-across-africa/).

We built a no-internet-required solution that allowed travellers landing in different countries to make local payments without needing local payment methods.

Imagine landing in Kenya - no internet because you don’t have a local sim card and no understanding of MPesa nor the exchange rates, yet still being able to make payments from your phone - that was tbDEX Go.

We were excited to have our idea validated in the hackathon and the opportunity to scale our solution up.

Shortly after however, the division at Block pioneering the technology was discontinued, meaning partnerships with PFIs like YellowCard and Chipper among others that underpinned our solution were no longer available.

Hence, the ~~million~~ ten thousand dollar question:

> what were we going to build?

In reality though, it was not much of a question, wasn't much of a deliberation either. We knew what, and why, just weren't sure how.

## I’m not poor, I just need more money

In 2021, I joined the workforce. Fresh-faced, expectant about all the things I could get by myself with my newfound income. Reality though, is often disappointing.

First paycheck comes in - "wow I get to keep all this?" - nope, I was broke before month end.
In fact, I was broke before month end _every month_. I was living paycheck to paycheck, every month. I was not too worried about it however, this was an entry level job, I'm supposed to be broke - things would right themselves. Right?

I gained experience, skills, started earning more. I was still broke before month's end. I gained experience, moved around, even juggled two roles for a while - I was still broke before month's end.

It started to feel less like "make more money" was the answer to my financial problems.

## Where's your money going then?

I set out to find solutions. Went to the internet, looking to find answers to my personal dilemma. Turns out however, my experiences were not unique at all. There's an entire world of people out there on the internet also trying to make sense of their money. Control it, as opposed to letting money be a hush-hush stressful topic. I found amazing Youtubers like [Nischa](https://www.youtube.com/@nischa) and [Humphrey Yang](https://www.youtube.com/@humphrey) who would preach the first rule in personal finance:

> To make any sense of your money, you need to know where it's going

This sounded easy enough. I need to keep track of my spending. I started on the journey, Nischa had a spreadsheet template I used. I would log out spending in the sheet and view them in relation to my predefined budgets.

The shift was monumental. Armed with the knowledge on where my money was going I was able to improve my spending by deciding beforehand what I was going to spend money on, letting me cover my essentials while leaving room for spending guilt-free on my wants.

## Better days

This was great, but there was a problem: I had to put in everything manually. I was motivated so I kept at it regardless but before long started looking for a way that would be easy to stick with long term.

I then found apps like YNAB and Spendee. They would let me track the transactions with a better interface and also advertised automatic bank sync so I would not have to manually put in everything. Great! No, not great. They didn't work for me :(

In fact, all of them didn't. These apps offered bank sync but this sync never worked for me. My banks were not even in the lists they'd offer to begin with.

In 2023, Eloke and I started talking about this problem. We decided we were going to build a personal finance app that let people track their spending automatically. We quickly found out why the automatic bank sync feature of these apps didn't work:

> Open Banking is a myth.

Especially in Africa.
